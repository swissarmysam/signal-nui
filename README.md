# :tv: Signal Video Streaming Website

A proof-of-concept natural user interface (NUI) using hand gestures and voice commands to control a video streaming website. This was selected as previous use-cases indicate that NUIs work best in an entertainment context. A streaming VOD site only requires a small set of clearly defined actions so that the user can play, skip, and navigate video content making it a prime example of using a NUI effectively.

The UI will be designed according to researched best practices to allow the user to navigate and select content easily. Whilst the UI will be adapted to make it suitable for the novel control scheme, it is crucial to maintain the core attributes of a streaming site, so it still feels familiar to the user.

Mouse control can be used if a webcam or speech recognition is not available.

_Some gestures have been removed as they had a lot of false detections. Reduced the total number of gestures required to 7 to reduce burden on user._

### :thumbsdown: Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Solution                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Website frozen                 | Refresh                                                                                                                      |
| Webcam not appearing           | Check developer console for error. If video source could not be loaded then try unplugging webcam and using a different port |
| Voice commands not working     | Please use an up-to-date version of Chrome                                                                                   |
| No sound effects               | Workaround: Try clicking on the webpage with the mouse and refreshing the page                                               |
| Wrong gesture detected         | Gestures need some fine-tuning so false detections do occur. Sorry!                                                          |
| Go back command is not working | If you are using the app locally then this is the behaviour on localhost. It will work on server hosted app.                 |
| Mic/camera stops working       | Clear the Chrome permissions and hard reload the website                                                                     |

### Known Issues

1. fullScreenRequest requires user interaction. Not able to fire custom event for this. Need to mimic something close to full screen behaviour.
2. No sound in video. This is due to how video is encoded. Sounds seems to be stripped. Looking for fix.
3. Sound FX need mouse interaction to start in Chrome. Not sure if there is a workaround for this?
4. Sometimes motion gestures result in custom event firing twice.

### Potential Improvements

- Add gesture recognition for two hands (this is waiting for update from Tensorflow team)
- Remove any unused CSS and JS to reduce overall app size
- Fine tune the gestures so they are recognised better
- Make progressive enhancement more graceful when using a browser other than Chrome
- Improve speech recognition so more general phrases could be used
- Add speech synthesis so voice feedback is provided to user
