# :tv: Signal Video Streaming Website

A proof-of-concept natural user interface (NUI) using hand gestures and voice commands to control a video streaming website. This was selected as previous use-cases indicate that NUIs work best in an entertainment context. A streaming VOD site only requires a small set of clearly defined actions so that the user can play, skip, and navigate video content making it a prime example of using a NUI effectively.

The UI will be designed according to researched best practices to allow the user to navigate and select content easily. Whilst the UI will be adapted to make it suitable for the novel control scheme, it is crucial to maintain the core attributes of a streaming site, so it still feels familiar to the user.

Mouse control can be used if a webcam or speech recognition is not available.
